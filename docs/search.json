In my day job I build and maintain predictive transportation models for the City of Durham.\r\n\r\nI like to think and write about policy related questions in a data science framework. Sometimes it’s fun, sometime’s it’s serious, hopefully more often than not it’s both!\r\nHere’s charlie, our rescue greyhound. You’ll probably be seeing him a lot here. Look at that snoot.\r\n\r\nFeel free to get in touch.\r\nEmail: jake.ford927@gmail.com.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
