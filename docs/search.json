Previously, I’ve worked in policy\nanalysis and applied mathematics at the state and local government\nlevel.\n\nI like to think and write about policy related questions in a data\nscience framework. Sometimes it’s fun, sometime’s it’s serious,\nhopefully more often than not it’s both!\nHere’s charlie, our rescue greyhound. You’ll probably be seeing him a\nlot here. Look at that snoot.\n\nFeel free to get in touch.\nEmail: jake.ford927@gmail.com.\n\n\n\n",
