## About


My name is Jake Ford, I live in Durham, North Carolina. I've worked in policy analysis and applied mathematics at the state and local government level.

I like to think and write about policy related questions in a data science framework. Sometimes it's fun, sometime's it's serious, hopefully more often than not it's both! 

This website is built using Rmarkdown's distill tool. In my day job I build and maintain predictive travel models for the City of Durham. Geospatial analysis comes pretty naturally, so expect some maps, geospatial tools like overlays, centroids, and tagging of all sorts.
