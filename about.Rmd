## About


My name is Jake Ford, I live in Durham, North Carolina. I've worked in policy analysis and applied mathematics at the state and local government level. In my day job I build and maintain predictive travel models for the City of Durham

I like to think and write about policy related questions in a data science framework. Sometimes it's fun, sometime's it's serious, hopefully more often than not it's both! 


Here's charlie, our rescue greyhound. You'll probably be seeing him a lot here.
